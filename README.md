# Matching-Coordinates
Given a two lists in excel of objects with latitudes and longitudes, matches the closest objects to each other

Need two excel files that have a number column, a longitude column, and a latitude column in the same folder as the .py file then just run the .py file and wait. The program will print the two objects that match each other and will insert all of them into a list. (can modify program to ignore distances that are too long)
